            <p class="justify-content" style="color: white;">
                Modern engineering challenges are defined by their complexity, scale, and the volume of data they generate. As a result, traditional experimental and analytical approaches, while being foundational, are often no longer sufficient on their own for designing, optimizing, and operating today’s advanced systems. Whether it's developing next-generation vehicles, designing resilient infrastructure or innovating in healthcare, engineers now rely on advanced computational tools and techniques to model, simulate, and analyze complex systems. Utilizing sophisticated algorithms, high-performance computing, and data-driven methods has become essential for achieving meaningful progress in these fields.<br>
                Computational Engineering addresses this critical need by integrating mathematical modeling, scientific computing, and data-driven methods into the engineering workflow. This enables engineers to:<br>
